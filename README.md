MS.TestPlatform
===============

MS.TestPlatform contains a BDD-style specification framework similar to MsTestContrib that can be used in conjunction with the MsTest (2012) platform framework.
So you can use it in tests for your WP8 or Windows Store App.  
One of the key benefits of this specification framework is that it gracefully extends your existing use of MsTest.
